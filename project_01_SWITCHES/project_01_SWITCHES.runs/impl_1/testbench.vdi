WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net xx_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin xx_reg_i_2/O, cell xx_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC ZPS7-1] PS7 block required: The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
